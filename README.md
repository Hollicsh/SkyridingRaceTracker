# Skyriding Race Timer

Skyriding Race Timer is an addon to display the current race time during a skyriding race. Additionally, you can see how long you have for the gold or silver medal.

Only the race times for the 'The War Within' extension are currently available. More will follow soon. Further customisation options for the timer display are planned.
